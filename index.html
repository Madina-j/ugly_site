        [Verse 1: Ella Fitzgerald]
        Stars shining bright above you
        Night breezes seem to whisper, I love you
        Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
        Dream a little dream of me

        [Verse 2: Ella Fitzgerald]
        Say nighty-night and kiss me
        Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
        While I'm alone and blue as can be
        Dream a little dream of me

        [Verse 3: Louis Armstrong]
        Stars fading but I linger on dear
        Still craving your kiss
        Now I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
        Just saying this

        [Verse 4: Ella Fitzgerald]
        Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
        Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
        But in your dreams whatever they be
        Dream a little dream of me

        [Verse 3: Both]
        Stars fading but I linger on dear
        Still craving your kiss
        I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
        Just saying this

        [Outro: Both]
        Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
        Leave the worries behind you
        But in your dreams, whatever may be
        You've gotta make me a promise, promise to me
        You'll dream, dream a little dream of me
